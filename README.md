# Mobile Web Specialist Certification Course

## Project Overview
#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_
For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, you will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, you will take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. You will also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

### Specification
You have been provided the code for a restaurant reviews website. The code has a lot of issues. It’s barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also doesn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it doesn’t work offline at all. Your job is to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality. 

### Note about ES6
Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code. As much as possible, try to maintain use of ES6 in any additional JavaScript you write.

## To Run Locally
API hosted at [mws-restaurant-api.herokuapp.com/](https://mws-restaurant-api.herokuapp.com/) 

#### Start frontend
Start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. 
In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: python -V. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use python3 -m http.server 8000. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's website to download and install the software.
Note - For Windows systems, Python 3.x is installed as python by default. To start a Python 3.x server, you can simply enter python -m http.server 8000.
With your server running, visit the site: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000), and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
